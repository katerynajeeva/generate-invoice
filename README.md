# Invoice Generator for Musicians üéª

This is a simple web-based invoice generator created as a personal project to help musicians, particularly freelancers in Vienna and Austria, easily create professional invoices.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive form for entering invoice details.
- **PDF Preview**: Real-time preview of the generated PDF on the same page.
- **Customizable**: Fields for `From`, `To`, `Date of Concert`, `Fee`, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable to various screen sizes, including mobile devices.

## Demo

You can check out a live demo [here](https://katerynajeeva.github.io/invoice-generator/).

## Usage

1. **Fill in the fields on the form**, including `From`, `To`, `Date of Concert`, `Fee`, etc.
2. **Preview your invoice in real-time** to see how it will look.
3. **Click the "Generate PDF" button** to download your invoice.

### Data Privacy and Security

- **No Data Sent to Server**: All information you input into the invoice generator is stored locally in your browser's `localStorage`. This means that none of your data, including your name, address, account number, or any other personal information, is sent to any server.
- **Persistent Storage**: The last entered data will be saved in your browser, so you don't need to re-enter everything each time you use the app.
- **Clearing Data**: Please note that if you clear your browser's cache or `localStorage`, all saved data will be lost, and you will need to re-enter the information.
